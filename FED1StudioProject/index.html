            Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch this. Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly 1:20 a.m. and zero seconds. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porces was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.

            What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. About how far ahead are you going? Children. Looks like a airplane, without wings. Right, I got it.

            I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Whoa, whoa, okay. I will. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?
